# Intro
Intro=After traveling for years, the research vessel HSS Halibut is finally approaching its target: Step, an as-of-yet lifeless planet, in a nearby star system. The mission of the Halibut is to begin preparing the planet for later human colonisation. The ship computer has begun the process of waking the scientists and engineers. This group includes you.


LookCryopod=The cryopods are laid out by the walls. Most of the pods are empty.
LookSealant=The sealant and a patch for hull repairs.
LookSpacesuit=The spacesuit is clumsy to wear, but it has to keep people safe from the vacuum.
nameCryopodCh1=cryopods
ProbeNotOpenedYet=You haven't opened the probe yet.


# Cryopod
cryopod=The computer display at your bedside tell your next task.
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step0=The display says, "All-crew meetup at breakfast."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step1=The display says, "Fix the leak in the probe bay."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step2=The display says, "Run analysis on the scan data."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step3=The display says, "Prepare and launch the dispersal probes."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step4=The display says, "All-crew meetup at the mess hall."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step5=The display says, "Prepare the lander and supplies."


Description_MessRoom_Base=The crew eats and has its meetings here in the mess room.


Meeting=Chris, the commander, sees you approach and begins the meeting. "On with it, then. Good morning you all. Unfortunately, two of the cryopods malfunctioned. A moment of silence for Ron and Gert. We're ten weeks from reaching orbit around Step, and we need to prep our probes and gear for the seeding. The probe bay has been struck with microdebris, and has been depressurized. The thrusters need be checked over before the approach run." Chris splits the repair and preparation tasks for everyone, including you. "You'll be patching up the probe bay and repressurizing it. Check your commpad for later tasks."

# Spacesuit

RemoveSpacesuit_BadIdea=Removing the spacesuit in the vacuum of space qualifies as a bad idea, so you don't do it.
WearSpacesuit=You put on the spacesuit and the oxygen tank.
RemovedSpacesuit=You took off the spacesuit and put it back on the rack.
BadUseOnObject=This wasn't the intended purpose.
ProbeBayAlreadyPressurised=The probe bay has already been repressurised, so pressing the button does nothing.
RepressuriseProbeBay=You hear the hiss of air as it refills the probe bay. The patch you applied appears to have fixed the only breach there was.
SealingBreach=You apply the patch and the sealant on the breach. This should keep the room pressurised.
CannotRepressuriseProbeBay=The ship computer has deduced the bay has a hull breach that hasn't been repaired yet, and refuses to repressurize the room.
NoIndoorsSpacesuit=You consider going into the hallway with the spacesuit on, but that would be just silly.
OutsideWithoutSpacesuitBadIdea=You'll need to wear a spacesuit before opening the airlock.

nameRepressurisationLever=lever
nameComputer=terminal

CannotEnterProbeBay=The door won't open. The computer screen beside it says the door is locked as long as the room is depressurized.

BreachUnfixed=A micrometeorite must've struck the bay here, leaving a puncture in the outer shell of the ship.

LookAirlockOutside=The airlock is tightly closed.

# Analysis section
ScanAnalysisResults=The analysis results from the remote scan have arrived. They describe the planet in terms of climate, hydrology, geology and atmospheric composition.
AutoAnalysisNotYetDone=The automated analysis results are not yet ready.
CorrectSoilAnswer="That should do it", you think.
AutomatedAnalysisNotRunning=The display says, "Long-range scan not yet complete."
AnalysisWentWrong=I don't think I got this right yet. Better try again.
CorrectWaterAnswer="That should do it", you think.
OpenScienceComputer=You sit down in the chair before the computer terminal.
CorrectAtmosphereAnswer="That should do it", you think.
CorrectClimateAnswer="That should do it", you think.

EarthWater=On Earth, 71 percent of the surface area is covered by water. The vast majority of the water on surface is stored in the oceans.
EarthSoil=The Earth crust is made of tectonic plates, which move slowly over eons. The edges of these plates are frequently seismically active, which may include volcanic activity.
EarthClimate=The ocean currents on Earth are highly important to the climate by balancing the hot and cold seasons. By contrast, continental climate has large temperature variation. The axial tilt, currently 23.5 degrees, affects how short and long polar nights and days are.
EarthAtmosphere=Earth atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen.

OwnAnalysisResults=You've finished writing your report. "Given the lack of a single connected ocean on the surface, all three oceans need to be seeded. The lack of surface area covered in water also means that a larger part of oxygen production will be have to take place on dry land. The geology of Step appears to suggest there has been recent tectonic activity. This limits the best options for the locations of a long-term base. The atmosphere contains mostly non-volatile gases such as nitrogen and noble gases. Carbon dioxide is present."

locationComputerDesktop=The computer is expecting your input.
locationComputerLibrary=The offline reference library has several articles, most relevantly statistical information on Earth.
locationQuizAtmosphere=The atmospheric pressure is estimated to be 1.2 standard atmospheres. The composition is 60 percent nitrogen, 30 percent carbon dioxide and 10 percent other gases, primarily noble gases. This means 1. the atmosphere is not breathable, 2. the atmosphere is volatile, or 3. the atmospheric pressure is crushing.
locationQuizWater=There are no true oceans on Step but three massive lakes that are not connected to one another; see Terran Caspian Sea. These amount to 20 percent of the total planet surface. This does not mean that 1. seeding all lakes with cyanobacteria and algae is unnecessary, 2. oxygen will be produced from CO2 primarily in seas, or 3. Step is as dry as Earth.
locationSoilQuiz=There are traces of recent volcanic activity in several locations. There are also mountain ranges that appear to have formed as a result of colliding tectonic plates. This means long-term zero-maintenance bases should be placed in 1. near these locations for available geothermal energy, 2. away from these for security, or 3. near rivers for hydrothermal energy.
locationQuizClimate=What will the climate be like on Step? 1. Temperate, 2. Large difference between cold and warm seasons, 3. Nearly constant.


TakeSealant=You take down the sealant kit from the shelf.
GoOutsideAirlock=You go inside the airlock and wait as the air is removed before stepping outside to the vacuum of space.
LookOutsideAirlock=Arrows point to the location of the airlock from all directions. Inside, you can see electric lights shining.
LookRepressurisationLever=This lever controls the pressurisation of the probe bay.
GoOutsideProbeBay=Holding on to a rope and the ship's body, you make your way around the ship towards the probe bay.

WrongClimateAnswer="That should do it", you think.
WrongAtmosphereAnswer="That should do it", you think.
WrongSoilAnswer="That should do it", you think.
WrongWaterAnswer="That should do it", you think.
#OpenComputer=You wake up the computer from its sleep mode.
LookOutsideProbeBay=The probe bay is "up" from here, if such directions mean anything in near zero G conditions.
LookComputer=This is the main terminal for analysing data from the probes. The actual computer is deep within the ship's body.

##

LookProbeWires=The probe has a large number of wires, but they're conveniently colour-coded.
locationProbe=This probe, on the lowest shelf, is the easiest to access.
LookProbe=The probe is a repurposed cruise missile, except that the warheads will be replaced with biological material to introduce Earth life to Step.
LookProbeHatch=This hatch holds underneath wires, screws, plates, and most importantly, the payload. The instructions to install payload have been painted on the hatch. First open the hatch, then detach the wires and finally remove the screws. To close it up again, do the same in reverse.
LookPayloadShelf=The various probe payloads are on these temperature-controlled vacuum-protected containers.
LookProbeScrew=The room for the probe payload is held in place by these screws.
LookProbeScrewCarried=You'll need to put these screws back in the probe.

##### Part 1 of the chapter

ChapterIntro_LT=HSS Halibut had arrived in the orbit around Step. The crew had repaired the damage the ship had taken during its interstellar voyage. There was no time for rest, as the crew made further analysis on the solar system that was to be their last home. Once the probes' launch paths had been calculated and recalculated for best expected results, the probes were launched to germinate the planet with Terran life. Cyanobacteria to produce oxygen and bind nitrogen from the atmosphere, moss and lichen to begin breaking down rocks and stones for nutrients and also create the beginnings of a biosphere on land. This would be a slow start, but maybe one day in the distant future, humans could walk on the planet without oxygen masks.
ChapterIntro2_LT=Now, you are making your way to the planet, alongside everyone else. The heatshield of the Halibut will protect the ship during the landing, but it will still be a tough landing in the water. Knowing there's a nuclear reactor coming down with you doesn't make it much easier to relax.

ReceivePhonecall_LT1=You've sat at your computer for an hour, when your phone rings. You've just been drafted to go to space.


StartFlashback=The photo is a picture of Earth. It's all but guaranteed you will not see your home again in this lifetime. As the atmosphere's forces on the ship become more and more pronounced, you focus your thoughts on a day you had back on Earth. It's not like you can do anything right now; piloting the ship is not in your wheelhouse.

LookUpHome=You look up from your seat. The ceiling lights are running on small batteries, as the main power source has been put offline for the duration of the landing.
LookBreakfast=Your breakfast is the usual: a granola bar.
LookMirror=The face looking you back in the mirror is your own.
LookPhone=Your phone isn't the newest model but a sensible budget-priced one. It gets the job done.
LookShower=The showerhead is getting messy again. You'll need to clean it one day, but not right now.
TakeBreakfast=You take your breakfast.
TakePhone=You pick up your phone.
TakeShower=You take a quick shower.
PutOnWorkClothes=You put on your work clothes: clean and pressed.
DressFirst=You should dress for work before leaving.
EatBreakfast=You'll eat the bar on the train as you wait for the ride to end.
LeaveToWork=You exit your apartment and close the door behind you. The heat outside your apartment is again overbearing, and the sun has yet to rise. You make your way to the train stop quickly and jump aboard the next one.
LookAtDoor=That's the apartment door, with extra locks.
RememberBreakfast=Don't forget your breakfast before you leave.
RememberPhone=You remember you need to pick up your phone before leaving.
ShowerFirst=The nightly heatwave has again left you sweaty, so you should take a shower before dressing up.

locationBathroom=This is your bathroom. A shower, a washing machine and a water tap have been enough for you.
locationBedroom=This is your bedroom, with a single bed.
locationLivingroom=Your livingroom is small, but enough to sit rainy days in.
locationCommute=You've taken this train already for several years. There's been talk about changing the time tables for the line, but you hope it won't be happening.
locationOffice=You've worked at this desk for years now.
nameBreakfast=cereal bar
nameClothes=clothes
nameCommuteStopChart=stop chart
nameMirror=mirror
namePhone=phone
nameShower=shower

##### Part 2 of the chapter
EndFlashback_LT=The landing in the ocean is happening soon. So many should-be's. The heatshield should be released to avoid holding too much weight. The ship should be able to hold water and float.

FallingDown_LT=You feel through your seat when the ship's thrusters come to life. The remainder of the solid rocket fuel on the ship would be used in the landing. After waiting a few minutes, you feel the ship jostle slightly. Those must have been the massive parachutes the ship deployed to slow down its descent.
SplashDownCountdown_LT=The speakers come to life as the commander calls out, "Take splashdown positions! Splashdown in five, four, three, two, one ---"
SplashDown_LT=The ship smashes into the sea with a massive splash. As it briefly plunges below the surface, its curved bottom redirects the momentum to turn the ship away from diving deeper into the unknown depths of the sea. A spaceship that would have to be able to make a dive into water - what a unique design task that must have been.
ReachingSurface_LT=As you feel the G-forces settle, the ship descends into silence. The ship's walls aren't creaking from the pressure of deep sea, and despite basically diving in a place you don't know what the seabed has and how deep, you haven't crashed into the bottom of the sea either. What feels like hours but must've been mere minutes, the commander addresses everyone again. "Our approach was successful, we're now floating on the sea." Everyone begins applauding and cheering.

TimelapseGoShore=As the ship propels itself towards the shore, you and the crew acclimate to being on a planet again. After a few days of stumbling, not made any easier by the rocking ship, the ship lands on firm ground.

ChapterIntro3_LT_pt1=The crew of HSS Halibut had cannibalised their ship to build a permanent base on Step, a dead planet. They jumpstarted the terraforming process as they waited for the main ship to arrive: a generation ship that would carry people and fauna ready to resume the task of changing the planet well-suited for human life.
ChapterIntro3_LT_pt2=Now, the pioneers were sleeping away time in their cryopods. The computer, with all its failsafe systems, was left to wait for the signal from the generation ship to wake up the slumbering crew. But things rarely go according to plan...

nameLoaderCh3=loader
nameRoverCh3=rover
nameToolkit=toolkit
nameWarning=warning

RechargedBattery=You insert the depleted battery into the charger. A few minutes later, the charger's light changes to indicate the battery has been recharged.
LookCommsOption=You click on the comms array icon. "Connection error: receiver not connected."
LookCryoOption=You click on the cryopod status icon. "Error: 10 Cryopod failures. Cryopods 3 and 7 open." You and Dave are the last remaining pioneers.
UseBatteryOnLoader=You replace the battery on the loader. Dave jumps inside it and starts removing the rocks blocking the entrance. From underneath the rocks you find the rover; its chassis bent but not quite broken. It'll need repairing before it can be used.
nameCommsOption=comms array
nameComputerCh3=computer
nameCryoOption=cryopods


nameSpareComponents=spare parts
nameTransmitterElectronics=circuits


ExamineTransmitterElectronics=It looks like there was no lightning rod nearby to protect the transmitter.
ExtractLoaderGuts=With the exit cleared, you don't foresee use for the loader and begin to salvage it for spare parts. Especially the recharged battery will likely be useful later down the road.
LookBatteryHatch=The hatch on the loader contains the battery the exoskeleton uses to power itself.
LookRoverBattery=The battery is of standard size and model, like nearly every other machinery battery on the Halibut was.
LookSpareComponents=These are a number of spare electonics components you salvaged from the loader.
LookTransmitterElectronics=The circuitry seems to be broken.
RepairTransmitter_LT=You replace obviously broken components with spare parts. You might not be able to transmit anything, but receiving a signal should be possible.
UseToolkitOnTransmitterElectronics=You look through the circuitry of the transmitter and try to spot where the components are broken. It looks like you'll need some spare components before you can fix the comms array.


LookRedButton=The button has a text "SHUTDOWN" on it.
NowhereToGo=You don't know where you'd go after shutting down the reactor. Better have a plan first.
TooEarlyToShutdown=You'll need to prepare first before shutting down the reactor.
WhyShutdown=Why should you shut down the reactor?
nameRedButton=red button


CannotWearLoaderBatteryEmpty=The loader's battery is empty; it'd serve no purpose to get in the loader.
DontOpenHatchYet=Your priority is to check what's up with the power plant.
LeaveTheBase=You and Dave get on the rover and leave the base. The transmission from the generation ship revealed they landed close enough that you should be able to make it there.
OpenLoaderHatch=You open the battery hatch on the loader. This reveals a battery behind it.
PlansAfterTransmission=You and Dave draft a plan. The food supplies, whatever is still left and edible anyway, are running low. With the cryopods' failure rate, even if you could repair the reactor the cryopods would be too dangerous to use. The new colony is your best hope to survive, if you can reach it.
PointlessUse=There's no point in doing that.
ReceiveTransmission=You catch human radio transmissions. You cannot send a message, but you can listen to them. After listening to the messages enough, you parse out that there's human activity over the ridge to the west of your base.
RepairRover=You replace the broken nuts and oil the bearings. You should now be able to drive on the rover again.
Shutdown_1=This is a moment of no turning back. You've loaded all the necessities you found on the rover, recharged the rover and included a spare battery. When the reactor shuts down, you won't know how to turn it back on. The shutdown procedure should be a safe one, but even then, it might be better to move away - just in case.
Shutdown_2=You click on the menu option to shut down the reactor. Without asking for verification, the computer starts the shutdown process. The computer's display turns off, and so does the whole computer. The emergency lights that were still intact had small batteries that wouldn't last long. You make your way back up quickly.


# LEFT THE BASE

locationFlatsCh3=The plains have flooded since the last time you saw them, half-covering the rocks under water.
locationDaveFlats=Dave looks at you. "Yes?"
nameRoverBattery=battery
nameTopicColony=colony
nameTopicLife=life on Step


TalkAboutLifeOnStep_1=You ask Dave if terraforming Step was the right move.
TalkAboutLifeOnStep_2=He responds, "Do you think we did right? The effort spent on Earth to not contaminate Lake Vostok, the effort not to introduce terrestrial life to Mars with the landers, rovers and all, and now we were sent here to deliberately do that?"
TalkAboutLifeOnStep_3="Genocide is about killing humans by their nationality or ethnicity. But if there was life on Step before our arrival and which terrestrial life will likely destroy, what would that make us?"
TalkAboutLifeOnStep_4="If there was life here, someone will find a name for us."

TalkAboutColonyOnStep_1=You ask Dave about the colonising Step. "We can't do worse than on Earth, can we? Or maybe I'm invoking Murphy's law by saying that. Earth is pretty much write-off for the foreseeable future, Mars will never be a hospitable place and Step has the best shot at fostering humanity for a longer period."



Chapter3Ending_1=As you climb over the ridge, you see a dome-shaped structure in front of you. Some moss grows around the dome. You see a figure, wearing a thin space suit, step out of the airlock at the edge of the dome. You have found the first human colony, and you and Dave are the last Earth-born humans on Step. This is where your future starts, even though you personally will not be seeing the terraforming process to finish.
CongratulationsGameOver=Congratulations. You have finished Step.
LastLegOfJourney=The rover's replacement battery lasts longer, but even that one runs out before you reach the colony.
LookRoverCh3=The rover didn't take well to being crushed under rocks. Its insides seem to have been protected, but the chassis took some damage.
LookRoverFlatsCh3=The rover's dead; its battery has run out. On the upside, you have a spare battery.
ReplaceRoverBattery=You replace the dead battery with another one, and the rover turns back on. You get on the rover, and carry on your westward travel.


LookLichenHillside=Some lichen grows on the rocks. It'll slowly dissolve the rock and release the nutrients to the wild.
LookMossFlats=The floodplain is well-covered by moss. This area may yet become wetlands.
LookMossHillside=Thick carpets of moss cover the ground near the hill.
nameLichen=lichen
nameMoss=moss
