# Intro
Intro=After traveling for years, the research vessel HSS Halibut is finally approaching its target: Step, an as-of-yet lifeless planet, in a nearby star system. The mission of the Halibut is to begin preparing the planet for later human colonisation. The ship computer has begun the process of waking the scientists and engineers. This group includes you.


LookCryopod=The cryopods are laid out by the walls. Most of the pods are empty.
LookSealant=The sealant and a patch for hull repairs.
LookSpacesuit=The spacesuit is clumsy to wear, but it has to keep people safe from the vacuum.
nameCryopodCh1=cryopods
ProbeNotOpenedYet=You haven't opened the probe yet.


# Cryopod
cryopod=The computer display at your bedside tell your next task.
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step0=The display says, "All-crew meetup at breakfast."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step1=The display says, "Fix the leak in the probe bay."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step2=The display says, "Run analysis on the scan data."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step3=The display says, "Prepare and launch the dispersal probes."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step4=The display says, "All-crew meetup at the mess hall."
LookAtComputerDisplay_Step5=The display says, "Prepare the lander and supplies."


Description_MessRoom_Base=The crew eats and has its meetings here in the mess room.


Meeting=Chris, the commander, sees you approach and begins the meeting. "On with it, then. Good morning you all. Unfortunately, two of the cryopods malfunctioned. A moment of silence for Ron and Gert. We're ten weeks from reaching orbit around Step, and we need to prep our probes and gear for the seeding. The probe bay has been struck with microdebris, and has been depressurized. The thrusters need be checked over before the approach run." Chris splits the repair and preparation tasks for everyone, including you. "You'll be patching up the probe bay and repressurizing it. Check your commpad for later tasks."

# Spacesuit

RemoveSpacesuit_BadIdea=Removing the spacesuit in the vacuum of space qualifies as a bad idea, so you don't do it.
WearSpacesuit=You put on the spacesuit and the oxygen tank.
RemovedSpacesuit=You took off the spacesuit and put it back on the rack.
BadUseOnObject=This wasn't the intended purpose.
ProbeBayAlreadyPressurised=The probe bay has already been repressurised, so pressing the button does nothing.
RepressuriseProbeBay=You hear the hiss of air as it refills the probe bay. The patch you applied appears to have fixed the only breach there was.
SealingBreach=You apply the patch and the sealant on the breach. This should keep the room pressurised.
CannotRepressuriseProbeBay=The ship computer has deduced the bay has a hull breach that hasn't been repaired yet, and refuses to repressurize the room.
NoIndoorsSpacesuit=You consider going into the hallway with the spacesuit on, but that would be just silly.
OutsideWithoutSpacesuitBadIdea=You'll need to wear a spacesuit before opening the airlock.

nameRepressurisationLever=lever
nameComputer=terminal

CannotEnterProbeBay=The door won't open. The computer screen beside it says the door is locked as long as the room is depressurized.

BreachUnfixed=A micrometeorite must've struck the bay here, leaving a puncture in the outer shell of the ship.

LookAirlockOutside=The airlock is tightly closed.

# Analysis section
ScanAnalysisResults=The analysis results from the remote scan have arrived. They describe the planet in terms of climate, hydrology, geology and atmospheric composition.
AutoAnalysisNotYetDone=The automated analysis results are not yet ready.
CorrectSoilAnswer="That should do it", you think.
AutomatedAnalysisNotRunning=The display says, "Long-range scan not yet complete."
AnalysisWentWrong=I don't think I got this right yet. Better try again.
CorrectWaterAnswer="That should do it", you think.
OpenScienceComputer=You sit down in the chair before the computer terminal.
CorrectAtmosphereAnswer="That should do it", you think.
CorrectClimateAnswer="That should do it", you think.

EarthWater=On Earth, 71 percent of the surface area is covered by water. The vast majority of the water on surface is stored in the oceans.
EarthSoil=The Earth crust is made of tectonic plates, which move slowly over eons. The edges of these plates are frequently seismically active, which may include volcanic activity.
EarthClimate=The ocean currents on Earth are highly important to the climate by balancing the hot and cold seasons. By contrast, continental climate has large temperature variation. The axial tilt, currently 23.5 degrees, affects how short and long polar nights and days are.
EarthAtmosphere=Earth atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen.

OwnAnalysisResults=You've finished writing your report. "Given the lack of a single connected ocean on the surface, all three oceans need to be seeded. The lack of surface area covered in water also means that a larger part of oxygen production will be have to take place on dry land. The geology of Step appears to suggest there has been recent tectonic activity. This limits the best options for the locations of a long-term base. The atmosphere contains mostly non-volatile gases such as nitrogen and noble gases. Carbon dioxide is present."

locationComputerDesktop=The computer is expecting your input.
locationComputerLibrary=The offline reference library has several articles, most relevantly statistical information on Earth.
locationQuizAtmosphere=The atmospheric pressure is estimated to be 1.2 standard atmospheres. The composition is 60 percent nitrogen, 30 percent carbon dioxide and 10 percent other gases, primarily noble gases. This means 1. the atmosphere is not breathable, 2. the atmosphere is volatile, or 3. the atmospheric pressure is crushing.
locationQuizWater=There are no true oceans on Step but three massive lakes that are not connected to one another; see Terran Caspian Sea. These amount to 20 percent of the total planet surface. This does not mean that 1. seeding all lakes with cyanobacteria and algae is unnecessary, 2. oxygen will be produced from CO2 primarily in seas, or 3. Step is as dry as Earth.
locationSoilQuiz=There are traces of recent volcanic activity in several locations. There are also mountain ranges that appear to have formed as a result of colliding tectonic plates. This means long-term zero-maintenance bases should be placed in 1. near these locations for available geothermal energy, 2. away from these for security, or 3. near rivers for hydrothermal energy.
locationQuizClimate=What will the climate be like on Step? 1. Temperate, 2. Large difference between cold and warm seasons, 3. Nearly constant.


TakeSealant=You take down the sealant kit from the shelf.
GoOutsideAirlock=You go inside the airlock and wait as the air is removed before stepping outside to the vacuum of space.
LookOutsideAirlock=Arrows point to the location of the airlock from all directions. Inside, you can see electric lights shining.
LookRepressurisationLever=This lever controls the pressurisation of the probe bay.
GoOutsideProbeBay=Holding on to a rope and the ship's body, you make your way around the ship towards the probe bay.

WrongClimateAnswer="That should do it", you think.
WrongAtmosphereAnswer="That should do it", you think.
WrongSoilAnswer="That should do it", you think.
WrongWaterAnswer="That should do it", you think.
#OpenComputer=You wake up the computer from its sleep mode.
LookOutsideProbeBay=The probe bay is "up" from here, if such directions mean anything in near zero G conditions.
LookComputer=This is the main terminal for analysing data from the probes. The actual computer is deep within the ship's body.

##

LookProbeWires=The probe has a large number of wires, but they're conveniently colour-coded.
locationProbe=This probe, on the lowest shelf, is the easiest to access.
LookProbe=The probe is a repurposed cruise missile, except that the warheads will be replaced with biological material to introduce Earth life to Step.
LookProbeHatch=This hatch holds underneath wires, screws, plates, and most importantly, the payload. The instructions to install payload have been painted on the hatch. First open the hatch, then detach the wires and finally remove the screws. To close it up again, do the same in reverse.
LookPayloadShelf=The various probe payloads are on these temperature-controlled vacuum-protected containers.
LookProbeScrew=The room for the probe payload is held in place by these screws.
LookProbeScrewCarried=You'll need to put these screws back in the probe.
