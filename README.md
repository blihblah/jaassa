Jäässä (MSX)

Jäässä is a simple adventure game for MSX, originally released in 2020. It is also a sample for a graphical adventure game engine.

The repo contains both the source code for the game and the Python scripts used to convert the data (text files and PNG images) for inclusion in the game.

The ASM source code is written for tniASM, for which the conversion tools also produce binaries etc.
