-[ TECH STUFF ]----------------------------------------------------------------

The ROM file uses ASCII16 mapper, so you may need to specify this on OpenMSX 
and WebMSX.

-[ HOW TO PLAY ]---------------------------------------------------------------

- use cursor keys / joystick 1 to select the option
- press left to cancel (move from choosing action back to choosing object)
  or on joystick, button 2.
- press fire/space bar to make the choice and advance the text.

There are no ways to die. If there is a way to get stuck, it's a bug.


-[ BACKGROUND ]----------------------------------------------------------------

The Earth is going to hell in a handbasket. Rather than trying to fix Earth,
humans have sent two spaceships to establish a colony on a planet presumed 
dead. The faster, smaller ship with its crew in cryogenic sleep to initiate
the process of terraforming the planet, and preparing for the arrival of the
bigger generation ship with humans, plants and some animals.

You are on the former ship.

2021-09-27 : Major uphaul to the game engine: now chapters are split over
             multiple pages and 16KB limit per chapter is gone. Added opened
             probe with its own new looks, thanks to the lost constraint.
2021-08-11 : Fixes to texts (wrong location descriptions, typos, ...)
             Broken quest scripts fixed in late chapter 2 (Antenna)
			 Changed sample quest finishing time in chapter 2
			 Added minor flavour text to chapter 1. 
			 Very minor update to graphics.
